Really finding it difficult to get those tweets based on hashtag and using numpy to read in those data, You can kindly add MORE Hashtags so that i can have large dataset to train the algorithm .Am going to use that Textblob library to get the sentiment of that tweets so as to train and test the algorithm.
The sentiment analysis using the random forest algorithm but the accuracy is very low.
